# Site playbook: Facebook Marketplace

Read this before you dispatch a computerUse subagent to this site. Follow the Fastest path, fill in every URL you know, then paste the Dispatch snippet into the Task text as written. The subagent does not read skills, so every rule it needs is in the snippet, including the ground rules at its end. Secrets never go in the Task text. They come through `RequestUserForm`.

## Facebook Marketplace search

### When to use

The user wants Marketplace listings for a query in a metro ("used Peloton under $500 within 20 miles of Austin, listed this week"), a category browse, or the details behind a `/marketplace/item/<id>/` link. The parent needs the query and the metro; ZIPs and free text city names do not work in the URL, only Facebook's city slug. The user gets id, title, price, city and state, thumbnail, delivery types, and item URL per listing, plus seller, description, photos, and posted time for a single item. Read only.

### Fastest path

`browser_navigate` to the search URL. The first page of results is server rendered as JSON in the HTML, so one navigation gives about 15 listings in earlier testing (24 on 2026-09-10, observed off box). There is no public Marketplace API, and `/api/graphql/` needs session bound `fb_dtsg`, `lsd`, and `jazoest` tokens, so there is no `curl` path.

Parent preflight. A box with no Facebook session usually gets the logged out splash on page one (`login_required_on_first_page`). Before dispatch, check for a signed-in Facebook session on the box, from a signed-in report earlier in this conversation. With no session, either sign in first with the Cursor-managed `sign-in` skill, or skip Marketplace and use the classifieds alternates the Task names. When the subagent reports `login_required_on_first_page`, do not send another logged-out dispatch: sign in as above and dispatch once more, or move to those alternates in the same turn.

```
https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/<slug>/search/?query=<urlenc-query>
```

Known good slugs in earlier testing are `nyc`, `la`, `sanfrancisco`, `chicago`, `austin`, `boston`, `seattle`, `atlanta`, `miami`, `portland`. Variants such as `newyork`, `losangeles`, `bayarea`, `sf`, `san-francisco`, `new-york`, a ZIP, or a numeric id all 302 to `/marketplace/category/search/`, which drops the location and falls back to the box IP's geo. For an unknown metro open `https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/`, use the location picker, and read the segment after `/marketplace/` in the resulting URL. For a category browse use `?category=<top-level>` or `/marketplace/<slug>/<top-level-category>`.

| Filter | Param | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Price | `minPrice`, `maxPrice` | integer, local currency |
| Days since listed | `daysSinceListed` | `1`, `7`, `30` |
| Condition | `itemCondition` | comma list of `new`, `used_like_new`, `used_good`, `used_fair` |
| Availability | `availability` | `in stock` (default), `out of stock`, `all` |
| Delivery | `deliveryMethod` | `local_pick_up`, `shipping`, omit for both |
| Radius (miles) | `radius` | `1`, `2`, `5`, `10`, `20`, `40`, `60`, `80`, `100`, `250`, `500`, default 40 |
| Sort | `sortBy` | `creation_time_descend`, `distance_ascend`, `price_ascend`, `price_descend`, omit for best match |
| Exact match | `exact` | `true`, `false` (default) |
| Category | `category` | `vehicles`, `propertyrentals`, `apparel`, `electronics`, `family`, `free`, `garden`, `hobbies`, `home`, `homeimprovement`, `musicalinstruments`, `officesupplies`, `petsupplies`, `sportinggoods`, `toys`, `bookmoviesmusic` |
| Vehicles | `make`, `model` | free text, case insensitive |
| Vehicles | `carType` | `sedan`, `coupe`, `hatchback`, `suv`, `truck`, `van`, `convertible`, `wagon`, `minivan`, `other` |
| Vehicles | `transmissionType` | `automatic`, `manual` |
| Vehicles | `minYear`, `maxYear`, `minMileage`, `maxMileage` | 4 digit year, integer miles |
| Vehicles | `vehicleExteriorColors`, `vehicleInteriorColors` | `black`, `white`, `silver`, `gray`, `red`, `blue`, `green`, `brown`, `tan`, `gold`, `orange`, `purple`, `yellow`, `other` |
| Vehicles | `titleStatus` | `clean`, `salvage`, `rebuilt`, `other` |
| Rentals | `minBedrooms`, `maxBedrooms`, `minBathrooms`, `maxBathrooms` | integer, `.5` for half baths |
| Rentals | `minAreaSize`, `maxAreaSize` | sqft |
| Rentals | `propertyType` | `apartment_condo`, `house`, `room`, `townhouse`, `mobile_manufactured`, `other` |
| Rentals | `privateRoomBathroomType` | `attached`, `not_attached`, `shared` |

Do not encode the commas in multi value params. Unknown params are silently dropped; confirm acceptance from the `params` echo in the HTML. Worked example.

```
https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/austin/search/?query=peloton&minPrice=100&maxPrice=500&daysSinceListed=7&radius=20&sortBy=creation_time_descend
```

### Dispatch snippet

```
Search Facebook Marketplace in <slug, one of nyc, la, sanfrancisco, chicago, austin, boston, seattle, atlanta, miami, portland> for "<query>" <filters>. Read only, never click Message, Make Offer, Save, Share, or Report.
Open https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/<slug>/search/?query=<url-encoded query><&minPrice=<n>&maxPrice=<n>><&daysSinceListed=1|7|30><&radius=<mi>><&sortBy=creation_time_descend|distance_ascend|price_ascend|price_descend><&category=<top-level-category>>. Wait 2 s.
If the URL changed to /marketplace/category/search/, stop and report location_resolution_failed. If it changed to /marketplace/ineligible/, stop and report page_profile_ineligible.
With a page script match /"marketplace_search":\{"feed_units":\{"edges":\[(.+?)\],"page_info":\{(.+?)\}\}/s on document.documentElement.outerHTML and parse the edges; also confirm "location_id" in the "params" block equals <slug>.
For each node.listing report id, marketplace_listing_title, listing_price.formatted_amount, location.reverse_geocode.city and state, delivery_types, is_sold, is_pending, primary_listing_photo.image.uri, and https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/<id>/.
If more are wanted, scroll down, wait 1.5 s, and read div[role="article"] cards with /marketplace/item/<id>/ links, up to <n> scrolls. If a "Log in or sign up" wall appears, stop scrolling and report partial results.
Take one screenshot. If a captcha, sign in or password, 2FA, or payment prompt appears, stop and report it with the URL.
Ground rules for this Task. A Timeout or a net::ERR_* code from browser_navigate means the box cannot reach that host. Do not retry it, even if the tool result says to, and do not run DNS or connectivity checks. Move to the next source this Task names, or report the code and URL. An HTTP block (403, 419, 429, 503) follows this Task's own rule. Work in the tab you start in. Do not open a second tab, and switch tabs only when a tool result names a page you did not intend. In-page tabs are part of the page. A page script is JavaScript for the page: run it with the run_code tool if you hold one. Without one, read rendered text from browser_snapshot or browser_find, read a <script> tag from the HTML that curl fetches in the box shell, and report a field neither yields as unreadable, never visible text in its place. Name the read you used. Snapshot a page state once. After a click, a scroll, or a wait this Task calls for, take one new snapshot. Do not snapshot the same state twice. Report as soon as the stop rule above is met, one line per item, only the fields asked for, no page dumps.
```

### Read the result

Search edges are `{ node: { listing: {...}, story_key } }`. Fields per `node.listing`.

```
id                                             canonical listing id, matches /marketplace/item/<id>/
marketplace_listing_title
listing_price.formatted_amount                 "$200"
listing_price.amount                           "200.00"
listing_price.amount_with_offset_in_currency   "20000" minor units
location.reverse_geocode.city / .state / .city_page.id / .city_page.display_name

marketplace_listing_category_id                numeric leaf category, no public name map
delivery_types                                 subset of ["IN_PERSON", "DOOR_PICKUP", "SHIPPING"]
is_live | is_sold | is_pending | is_hidden | is_viewer_seller
strikethrough_price                            original price if discounted
custom_sub_titles_with_rendering_flags         [{"subtitle":"19K miles"}] for vehicles
```

Lat/lon, description, seller, full photos, condition, and posted time are not in search results. The item page's `marketplace_listing_renderable` adds `description` or `redacted_description`, `listing_photos[].image.uri`, `marketplace_listing_seller.name` and `.id` (profile `https://www.facebook.com/<seller.id>/`), `creation_time` (epoch seconds), `location_text`, `location.latitude`, `location.longitude`, `condition_description`, `custom_attributes` (vehicle VIN, fuel_type, title_status, transmission, body_style, exterior_color, interior_color; apparel size, brand; rental bedrooms, bathrooms, area_size, property_type), and the full `delivery_types`. In earlier testing the item page payload was inferred from schema references, not read end to end. In earlier testing `radius=20` echoed `filter_radius_km: 32`; on 2026-09-10 it echoed `filter_radius_km: 20` (observed off box), so read the unit from the echo. Search `delivery_types` may omit `SHIPPING`. Photo URLs on `scontent-*.xx.fbcdn.net` are signed and expire (`oe=` param). Never include `node.tracking` in the output.

### When blocked

- In earlier testing a plain cloud session got a logged out splash or an empty `marketplace_search` and a stealth residential session was needed. The box hits the same wall without a Facebook session, and changing the URL does not help.
- The user's own Chrome profile may already be signed in to Facebook, which in earlier testing is what deep pagination needs.
- Login wall. After about 5 to 10 scroll pages without auth Facebook inserts "Log in or sign up for Facebook to connect with friends, family and people you know". Detect that text or `/log in to (see more|continue)/i`. Do not use the `"login_form"` substring as the tell; it is present in the HTML of a normally served signed out results page (observed 2026-09-10 off box, with 24 listings parsed from the same HTML). Return what was extracted with `partial: true` and the page count. Do not dismiss it, register, or scroll past.
- A login wall on page one means Facebook served the logged out splash. The tell is zero `marketplace_search` edges together with that text. Stop and report `login_required_on_first_page`.
- The parent does not re-dispatch to Marketplace in that session. It either gets a session as in the preflight and dispatches once more after the session is confirmed, or moves to the classifieds alternates the Task names, in the same turn.
- A redirect to `/marketplace/ineligible/` or a notice that Pages cannot use Marketplace means the box's Facebook session is acting as a Page.
- Stop and report `page_profile_ineligible`; the parent asks the user to switch that session to their personal profile, then dispatches once more.
- "Marketplace isn't available" means the region is unsupported. Report `region_unavailable`.
- If the page asks for a password, 2FA code, captcha, or payment, stop. Do not solve or bypass. Report which wall appeared and the URL it was on.

## Working with the subagent

Recipe steps name actions, not tools. A page script, a scroll, or a fill lands on whichever browser tools the subagent holds, and the ground rules say how, so paste the snippet as written. A subagent without a page-script tool reads what the snapshot or a shell fetch shows and names that read in its report.

Fill in every URL you know before you dispatch. A dispatch that changes something on the site (a cart, a booking, a form) never goes out without its URL. A read-only lookup may start from a name and a place when its section allows it. When the Fastest path is a shell call, run it with a short timeout and never queue a second lookup behind it. A failed call follows the section's own rule for that response (a single retry, a fresh key, or stop and report); when the section has no rule for it, or the call hangs, dispatch the subagent at once. When the section says the call is unreliable from the box, dispatch in the same round and stop the subagent with `StopSubagent` if the call returns first. A change to a job in flight goes to the same subagent, with `MessageSubagent` while it runs and `Task` with `resume` after it reports. A fresh dispatch spends rounds finding a tab and re-reading the page before it does anything.
